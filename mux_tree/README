This tricky bit of generic Verilog can generate a fully pipelined MUX up to 
4096 nodes wide. It has an II of 1, and a latency of ceil(log_4(num_inputs)).

The easiest way to understand it is to set the default in and run it through
Vivado's schematic generator (in the elaborated design).


Please refer to the discussion in sources/parallel_cores/arbitration/README 
about generic trees in Verilog. The approach used here is the same, except for 
a 4-ary tree instead of a binary tree.
