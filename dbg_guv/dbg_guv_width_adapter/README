To build the testbench, you will require sonar, an excellent tool developed
by Varun Sharma:

https://github.com/sharm294/sonar

This takes a nice Python script and auto-generates the hideous SystemVerilog
that would otherwise be necessary.

Note: I am using sonar-3.1.0.dev0, with the following modification:

    axis.py, lines 134-138 (https://github.com/sharm294/sonar/blob/e28c424bc925a748d1cdc210b6719094445b6159/sonar/core/include/interfaces/axis.py#L134-L138)
    
    REPLACE:
    
    <   if word["tkeep"] != 0:  # exclude debug statements
    <       line += packet["type"] + " " + packet["interface"] + " " + str(len(sv_args))
    <       for arg in sv_args:
    <           line += " " + str(word[arg])
    <       line += "\n"
    
    WITH:
    
    >   line += packet["type"] + " " + packet["interface"] + " " + str(len(sv_args))
    >   for arg in sv_args:
    >       line += " " + str(word[arg])
    >   line += "\n"

In other words, remove the condition and run the if statement body 
unconditionally.
